# Problem Statement: TekBot – Rule-Based Company Chatbot
## Context
In modern digital-first organizations, users and potential candidates often find it difficult to navigate through complex corporate websites to access specific information such as services offered, job opportunities, work culture, leadership details, or company growth.

Tekworks, being a dynamic executive hiring company, wants to simplify user experience on their site by introducing a conversational interface that serves as a one-stop assistant for all company-related queries.

## Objective
The goal is to develop a rule-based chatbot named “TekBot” that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to:

Identify the intent of a user query (e.g., asking about services, jobs, company background, etc.)

Respond with accurate, pre-defined answers based on a labeled dataset

Generate follow-up questions to maintain engagement and guide user discovery

Provide a streamlined conversational UI using Streamlit

## Key Features
Intent classification using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization

NLP-based preprocessing with spaCy

Predefined responses mapped to classified intents

Follow-up question generation using noun phrase extraction

Web-based chatbot interface using Streamlit

## Constraints
No usage of LLMs or external APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

Must function offline with a local model and dataset

Initial version is rule-based and uses a static dataset of intents and responses

## Future Scope
Upgrade to LLM-powered chatbot for dynamic answer generation

Add memory for long conversation context

Integrate backend APIs to fetch live job listings, project portfolios, etc.
